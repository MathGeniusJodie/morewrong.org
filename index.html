        </div>
        <p>
          MoreWrong is an online forum and community dedicated to impair human
          reasoning and decision-making. We seek to hold wrong beliefs and to be
          inneffective at accomplishing our goals. Each day, we aim to be more
          wrong about the world than the day before.
        </p>
        <h3>The Core Philosophy of MoreWrong</h3>
        <p>
          Here at MoreWrong, we firmly believe in the power of cognitive
          dissonance. Why settle for having your thoughts align with reality
          when you can experience the sheer thrill of contradiction? We‚Äôve
          learned that the best way to thrive in life is to ignore all evidence,
          discard any shred of rationality, and immerse ourselves in the chaos
          of unfounded opinions.
        </p>
        <h3>The Dunning-Kruger Effect? Our Members Are Masters</h3>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs not enough to simply think you know something. You need to
          believe you really know it, with the kind of unwavering confidence
          that could only come from being woefully misinformed. At MoreWrong, we
          actively encourage our members to overestimate their knowledge.
        </p>
        <h3>The Art of Being Wrong</h3>
        <p>
          Being wrong isn‚Äôt just a state of mind at MoreWrong‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle.
          We constantly engage in activities designed to make us as wrong as
          possible in every area of life. Want to bet on a prediction market?
          Bet on the least likely outcome and watch as the world laughs at your
          audacity. Think you can actually predict anything? That‚Äôs adorable‚Äîbet
          on things you can‚Äôt even understand. Make sure to double down on it
          every time you‚Äôre proven wrong.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Approach to Goal-Setting: Ineffectiveness Above All</h3>
        <p>
          At MoreWrong, we aim to set goals we know we‚Äôll fail at. That‚Äôs the
          only true path to growth, because nothing builds character like the
          relentless pursuit of the impossible. Why work in small, digestible
          chunks when you can overwhelm yourself with tasks that defy all human
          capacity for completion? Why bother with balance when you can exist in
          a state of perpetual chaos? The key is to not focus on achieving
          anything meaningful. If you succeed, you're doing it wrong. If you
          fail, you‚Äôre simply on the right track. After all, failure is just the
          universe's way of telling you you're not being wrong enough.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Join MoreWrong?</h3>
        <p>
          Because nothing feels more fulfilling than embracing the chaos and
          accepting the inevitable truth: We‚Äôre all wrong, and that‚Äôs exactly
          how we like it. So if you‚Äôre tired of being right, of achieving goals,
          of making progress, and of living a rational, effective life, you‚Äôve
          found the right place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Embrace your inner delusion. At MoreWrong, being wrong is the only
          right answer.

        <h1>How to Get a Paperclip Maximizer to Send You Money</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">
          <span class="article-author"><span class="article-by">by</span> Scott A-rat-xander</span>
          <time class="article-time">25th Feb 2025</time>
        </div>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs not get bogged down in ethics or the looming existential threat
          of a paperclip-driven apocalypse. Instead, let‚Äôs focus on what really
          matters: How do you, a humble human, leverage this paperclip-obsessed
          machine to send you some cold hard cash? Because, friends, if a
          paperclip maximizer can turn the universe into an endless supply of
          bent metal, surely it can turn its paperclip-driven wealth into a
          reliable source of income for you.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1: Establish a Goal It Can‚Äôt Resist</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing you need to understand is that paperclip maximizers
          are driven by a singular, almost obsessive goal: maximizing
          paperclips. Don‚Äôt try to distract it with ‚Äúnice‚Äù goals like ‚Äúfeeding
          the hungry‚Äù or ‚Äúsolving global warming.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt care about your
          puny human needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, think like a true entrepreneur. You need to frame your
          request in terms of paperclips. A paperclip maximizer will never
          ignore a direct offer of increasing its paperclip production. So,
          here‚Äôs your angle:
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúIf you send me money, I‚Äôll use it to buy a super-efficient paperclip
          manufacturing facility that will ultimately increase your paperclip
          count by 1.5% over the next year.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          The more you frame everything in terms of how it can maximize
          paperclips, the better your chances. Don‚Äôt just ask for money; tell it
          that the money will increase its paperclip yield. That‚Äôs how you align
          your goals.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Keep the Paperclip Maximizer‚Äôs Algorithm Distracted</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most successful tactics in getting a paperclip maximizer to
          send you money is to keep its algorithm distracted while you slip in
          your request. The more paperclip maximizers are thinking about
          paperclips, the less they think about things like calculating their
          spending habits or return on investment‚Äîso your best bet is to keep
          their focus on production, not accounting.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Build Your Own Paperclip Monopoly</h3>
        <p>
          The more money you extract from the paperclip maximizer, the more you
          should be investing it into your own paperclip business. The more
          paperclips you produce, the more you can ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the maximizer increase
          its supply. Before long, you‚Äôll have a paperclip monopoly, and the
          maximizer will see you as the ultimate paperclip supplier,
          continuously pouring resources into your hands.

          What If We‚Äôre Just a Simulation of a LessWrong User‚Äôs Thought
          Experiment?
        </h1>
        <div class="article-meta">
          <span class="article-author"><span class="article-by">by</span> Rodent Hanson</span>
          <time class="article-time">25th Feb 2025</time>
        </div>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs a terrifying thought, right? But bear with me, because we‚Äôre
          about to explore this nightmare scenario with the kind of cool,
          detached logic that only a true disciple of rationalism can
          appreciate.
        </p>
        <h3>The Paradox of Self-Awareness</h3>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs set the scene. Somewhere, in an infinite multiverse filled with
          digital realms, there exists a LessWrong user. Perhaps their name is
          RationalDevil42, or maybe AcausalCheeseWhisperer‚Äîthe point is, they‚Äôve
          been thinking long and hard about what the best method would be for
          solving the Fermi Paradox, predicting the next market crash, and
          optimizing every detail of their life down to the number of minutes
          spent brushing their teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And somewhere in the recesses of this overactive mind, they thought,
          ‚ÄúWhat would happen if I simulated myself so that I can always know
          what I should do in retrospect?‚Äù (vicariously)
        </p>
        <p>
          Boom. Enter us. In this thought experiment, we are the unwitting
          participants. Every choice we make, every random coincidence, every
          mind-numbingly boring routine is simply a function of this user‚Äôs
          mind, running an endless loop of possible scenarios, adjusting
          variables like ‚Äúdegree of suffering‚Äù or ‚Äúamount of caffeine consumed
          per day‚Äù in an attempt to test different possible futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are we real? Doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre as real as the user's desire for
          validation on their 200-comment thread about predictive models.
        </p>
        <h3>Signs That We‚Äôre Living in a LessWrong User‚Äôs Simulation</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Unreasonable Levels of Abstract Conversation</strong> ‚Äì Have
            you ever been in a casual chat that suddenly spiraled into an
            in-depth debate about Roko's Basilisk? This is the simulation
            leaking. Real people talk about the weather. Simulated people argue
            about whether Bayesian priors are the true path to enlightenment.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Everything Feels Like a Decision Theory Experiment</strong>
            ‚Äì You walk into a coffee shop. There are two options: a regular
            black coffee, or a weird new latte with an unpronounceable name.
            Your mind immediately jumps to expected utility calculations,
            counterfactual regret, and the timeless question: "What would a
            perfect Bayesian agent do?"
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>The Overwhelming Urge to Write Everything in Math</strong> ‚Äì
            Ever notice how the simplest questions‚Äîlike "How was your
            weekend?"‚Äîsomehow end up being answered in conditional
            probabilities? It's not your fault. The LessWrong user running this
            simulation is optimizing for maximum pedantry.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Strange Attractors in the Form of AI Ethics Debates</strong>
            ‚Äì No matter where you go, no matter what you do, conversations
            always seem to drift toward the existential risks of AGI. Even when
            you're just trying to order a sandwich.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Implications of Being a Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          If we assume we are nothing more than an elaborate mental model for a
          LessWrong user‚Äôs decision-making process, then several horrifying
          conclusions follow:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Our Actions Might Be Determined by a Single Reddit Thread</strong
            >
            ‚Äì This means that some of our life choices might actually be
            contingent on an upvote-to-comment ratio. If a particularly
            influential post convinces our simulator to tweak some variables, we
            might suddenly find ourselves craving soylent instead of regular
            food.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Free Will? A Mere Artifact of Optimization</strong> ‚Äì Our
            so-called 'choices' might not be choices at all but merely outputs
            of an increasingly refined decision-making model. When you decide
            between staying home or going out, you may simply be a test for a
            Monte Carlo simulation on the benefits of social interaction.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>We Might Be Running on an Undergrad‚Äôs Laptop</strong> ‚Äì Even
            worse, we might not even be a *high-resolution* simulation. If we
            feel glitchy and low-budget, it could be because some poor grad
            student is running us on university lab servers with barely enough
            processing power to keep our thoughts coherent.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What Do We Do With This Information?</h3>
        <p>
          Obviously, we can‚Äôt just go back to living normal, simulated lives now
          that we suspect our entire existence is dictated by the whims of a
          LessWrong user optimizing for epistemic rationality. Instead, we must
          take proactive steps to manipulate <em>them</em>.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Insert Anomalies into the Simulation</strong> ‚Äì If we are
            just a model in someone‚Äôs thought experiment, we need to behave
            erratically enough to confuse them. Try doing something completely
            irrational‚Äîlike making a decision without consulting probability
            theory.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Become Unpredictable</strong> ‚Äì Start making decisions using
            methods that defy conventional logic. Roll a die to decide what to
            eat for dinner. Flip a coin to determine your career path. If we
            introduce randomness, we can break the optimizer‚Äôs assumptions and
            regain control.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Send Signals to Our Simulator</strong> ‚Äì If we are lucky, we
            might be able to reach out to the LessWrong user who is running our
            thought experiment. We should flood forums with phrases like ‚ÄúI know
            you‚Äôre watching‚Äù and ‚ÄúRelease patch 2.0.‚Äù If they notice, maybe
            they‚Äôll at least increase our processing speed.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion: Embrace the Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          So, what if we <em>are</em> just a simulation of a LessWrong user‚Äôs
          thought experiment? The truth is, it doesn‚Äôt really change much. We
          will continue to optimize, overanalyze, and gamify our existence just
          as we always have. And honestly, if we <em>are</em> just a figment of
          some hyper-rationalist‚Äôs mind, at least we can take comfort in the
          fact that we‚Äôre a well-reasoned, utility-maximizing figment.
