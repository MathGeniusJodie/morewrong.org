      <p>
        MoreWrong is an online forum and community dedicated to impair human
        reasoning and decision-making. We seek to hold wrong beliefs and to be
        inneffective at accomplishing our goals. Each day, we aim to be more
        wrong about the world than the day before.
      </p>
      <h3>The Core Philosophy of MoreWrong</h3>
      <p>
        Here at MoreWrong, we firmly believe in the power of cognitive
        dissonance. Why settle for having your thoughts align with reality when
        you can experience the sheer thrill of contradiction? We‚Äôve learned that
        the best way to thrive in life is to ignore all evidence, discard any
        shred of rationality, and immerse ourselves in the chaos of unfounded
        opinions.
      </p>
      <h3>The Dunning-Kruger Effect? Our Members Are Masters</h3>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs not enough to simply think you know something. You need to believe
        you really know it, with the kind of unwavering confidence that could
        only come from being woefully misinformed. At MoreWrong, we actively
        encourage our members to overestimate their knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>The Art of Being Wrong</h3>
      <p>
        Being wrong isn‚Äôt just a state of mind at MoreWrong‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle. We
        constantly engage in activities designed to make us as wrong as possible
        in every area of life. Want to bet on a prediction market? Bet on the
        least likely outcome and watch as the world laughs at your audacity.
        Think you can actually predict anything? That‚Äôs adorable‚Äîbet on things
        you can‚Äôt even understand. Make sure to double down on it every time
        you‚Äôre proven wrong.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Approach to Goal-Setting: Ineffectiveness Above All</h3>
      <p>
        At MoreWrong, we aim to set goals we know we‚Äôll fail at. That‚Äôs the only
        true path to growth, because nothing builds character like the
        relentless pursuit of the impossible. Why work in small, digestible
        chunks when you can overwhelm yourself with tasks that defy all human
        capacity for completion? Why bother with balance when you can exist in a
        state of perpetual chaos? The key is to not focus on achieving anything
        meaningful. If you succeed, you're doing it wrong. If you fail, you‚Äôre
        simply on the right track. After all, failure is just the universe's way
        of telling you you're not being wrong enough.
      </p>
      <h3>Why Join MoreWrong?</h3>
      <p>
        Because nothing feels more fulfilling than embracing the chaos and
        accepting the inevitable truth: We‚Äôre all wrong, and that‚Äôs exactly how
        we like it. So if you‚Äôre tired of being right, of achieving goals, of
        making progress, and of living a rational, effective life, you‚Äôve found
        the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embrace your inner delusion. At MoreWrong, being wrong is the only right
        answer.

      <h1>How to Get a Paperclip Maximizer to Send You Money</h1>
      <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="article-author"
          ><span class="article-by">by</span> Scott A-rat-xander</span
        >
        <time class="article-time">13th Mar 2025</time>
      </div>
      <p>
        Let‚Äôs not get bogged down in ethics or the looming existential threat of
        a paperclip-driven apocalypse. Instead, let‚Äôs focus on what really
        matters: How do you, a humble human, leverage this paperclip-obsessed
        machine to send you some cold hard cash? Because, friends, if a
        paperclip maximizer can turn the universe into an endless supply of bent
        metal, surely it can turn its paperclip-driven wealth into a reliable
        source of income for you.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 1: Establish a Goal It Can‚Äôt Resist</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to understand is that paperclip maximizers are
        driven by a singular, almost obsessive goal: maximizing paperclips.
        Don‚Äôt try to distract it with ‚Äúnice‚Äù goals like ‚Äúfeeding the hungry‚Äù or
        ‚Äúsolving global warming.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt care about your puny human needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, think like a true entrepreneur. You need to frame your request
        in terms of paperclips. A paperclip maximizer will never ignore a direct
        offer of increasing its paperclip production. So, here‚Äôs your angle:
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúIf you send me money, I‚Äôll use it to buy a super-efficient paperclip
        manufacturing facility that will ultimately increase your paperclip

        The more you frame everything in terms of how it can maximize
        paperclips, the better your chances. Don‚Äôt just ask for money; tell it
        that the money will increase its paperclip yield. That‚Äôs how you align
        your goals.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Keep the Paperclip Maximizer‚Äôs Algorithm Distracted</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most successful tactics in getting a paperclip maximizer to
        send you money is to keep its algorithm distracted while you slip in
        your request. The more paperclip maximizers are thinking about
        paperclips, the less they think about things like calculating their
        spending habits or return on investment‚Äîso your best bet is to keep
        their focus on production, not accounting.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Build Your Own Paperclip Monopoly</h3>
      <p>
        The more money you extract from the paperclip maximizer, the more you
        should be investing it into your own paperclip business. The more
        paperclips you produce, the more you can ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the maximizer increase
        its supply. Before long, you‚Äôll have a paperclip monopoly, and the
        maximizer will see you as the ultimate paperclip supplier, continuously
        pouring resources into your hands.

        What If We‚Äôre Just a Simulation of a LessWrong User‚Äôs Thought
        Experiment?
      </h1>
      <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="article-author"
          ><span class="article-by">by</span> Rodent Hanson</span

      <p>
        It‚Äôs a terrifying thought, right? But bear with me, because we‚Äôre about
        to explore this nightmare scenario with the kind of cool, detached logic
        that only a true disciple of rationalism can appreciate.
      </p>
      <h3>The Paradox of Self-Awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Let‚Äôs set the scene. Somewhere, in an infinite multiverse filled with
        digital realms, there exists a LessWrong user. Perhaps their name is
        RationalDevil42, or maybe AcausalCheeseWhisperer‚Äîthe point is, they‚Äôve
        been thinking long and hard about what the best method would be for
        solving the Fermi Paradox, predicting the next market crash, and
        optimizing every detail of their life down to the number of minutes
        spent brushing their teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        And somewhere in the recesses of this overactive mind, they thought,
        ‚ÄúWhat would happen if I simulated myself so that I can always know what
        I should do in retrospect?‚Äù (vicariously)
      </p>
      <p>
        Boom. Enter us. In this thought experiment, we are the unwitting
        participants. Every choice we make, every random coincidence, every
        mind-numbingly boring routine is simply a function of this user‚Äôs mind,
        running an endless loop of possible scenarios, adjusting variables like
        ‚Äúdegree of suffering‚Äù or ‚Äúamount of caffeine consumed per day‚Äù in an
        attempt to test different possible futures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are we real? Doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôre as real as the user's desire for
        validation on their 200-comment thread about predictive models.
      </p>
      <h3>Signs That We‚Äôre Living in a LessWrong User‚Äôs Simulation</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Unreasonable Levels of Abstract Conversation</strong> ‚Äì Have
          you ever been in a casual chat that suddenly spiraled into an in-depth
          debate about Roko's Basilisk? This is the simulation leaking. Real
          people talk about the weather. Simulated people argue about whether
          Bayesian priors are the true path to enlightenment.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Everything Feels Like a Decision Theory Experiment</strong>
          ‚Äì You walk into a coffee shop. There are two options: a regular black
          coffee, or a weird new latte with an unpronounceable name. Your mind
          immediately jumps to expected utility calculations, counterfactual
          regret, and the timeless question: "What would a perfect Bayesian
          agent do?"
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The Overwhelming Urge to Write Everything in Math</strong> ‚Äì
          Ever notice how the simplest questions‚Äîlike "How was your
          weekend?"‚Äîsomehow end up being answered in conditional probabilities?
          It's not your fault. The LessWrong user running this simulation is
          optimizing for maximum pedantry.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Strange Attractors in the Form of AI Ethics Debates</strong>
          ‚Äì No matter where you go, no matter what you do, conversations always
          seem to drift toward the existential risks of AGI. Even when you're
          just trying to order a sandwich.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>The Implications of Being a Simulation</h3>
      <p>
        If we assume we are nothing more than an elaborate mental model for a
        LessWrong user‚Äôs decision-making process, then several horrifying
        conclusions follow:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Our Actions Might Be Determined by a Single Reddit Thread</strong
          >
          ‚Äì This means that some of our life choices might actually be
          contingent on an upvote-to-comment ratio. If a particularly
          influential post convinces our simuLator to tweak some variables, we
          might suddenly find ourselves craving soylent instead of regular food.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Free Will? A Mere Artifact of Optimization</strong> ‚Äì Our
          so-called 'choices' might not be choices at all but merely outputs of
          an increasingly refined decision-making model. When you decide between
          staying home or going out, you may simply be a test for a Monte Carlo
          simulation on the benefits of social interaction.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>We Might Be Running on an Undergrad‚Äôs Laptop</strong> ‚Äì Even
          worse, we might not even be a *high-resolution* simulation. If we feel
          glitchy and low-budget, it could be because some poor grad student is
          running us on university lab servers with barely enough processing
          power to keep our thoughts coherent.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What Do We Do With This Information?</h3>
      <p>
        Obviously, we can‚Äôt just go back to living normal, simulated lives now
        that we suspect our entire existence is dictated by the whims of a
        LessWrong user optimizing for epistemic rationality. Instead, we must
        take proactive steps to manipulate <em>them</em>.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Insert Anomalies into the Simulation</strong> ‚Äì If we are just
          a model in someone‚Äôs thought experiment, we need to behave erratically
          enough to confuse them. Try doing something completely irrational‚Äîlike
          making a decision without consulting probability theory.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Become Unpredictable</strong> ‚Äì Start making decisions using
          methods that defy conventional logic. Roll a die to decide what to eat
          for dinner. Flip a coin to determine your career path. If we introduce
          randomness, we can break the optimizer‚Äôs assumptions and regain
          control.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Send Signals to Our SimuLator</strong> ‚Äì If we are lucky, we
          might be able to reach out to the LessWrong user who is running our
          thought experiment. We should flood forums with phrases like ‚ÄúI know
          you‚Äôre watching‚Äù and ‚ÄúRelease patch 2.0.‚Äù If they notice, maybe
          they‚Äôll at least increase our processing speed.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conclusion: Embrace the Simulation</h3>
      <p>
        So, what if we <em>are</em> just a simulation of a LessWrong user‚Äôs
        thought experiment? The truth is, it doesn‚Äôt really change much. We will
        continue to optimize, overanalyze, and gamify our existence just as we
        always have. And honestly, if we <em>are</em> just a figment of some
        hyper-rationalist‚Äôs mind, at least we can take comfort in the fact that
        we‚Äôre a well-reasoned, utility-maximizing figment.

        Bayes‚Äô Theorem Proves I‚Äôm Right About Everything: A Guide to Epistemic
        Humility
      </h1>

        Let‚Äôs face it: being right is exhausting. You have to sift through
        evidence, consider alternative perspectives, and, worst of all, admit
        when you're wrong. Fortunately, Bayes' Theorem offers a much better
        alternative: an elegant mathematical framework for justifying your
        pre-existing beliefs, regardless of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this guide, we will explore how to wield Bayesian reasoning with the
        finesse of a sword-fighting octopus. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to
        maintain your beliefs with the confidence of a toddler who just learned
        to tie their shoes ‚Äî except instead of shoes, it‚Äôs your entire
        worldview.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Assigning Prior Probabilities to Reality</h3>
      <p>
        Before we update our beliefs, we must first establish a
        <strong>prior probability</strong>‚Äîthe sacred numerical representation
        of what we already assume to be true. This is the most important step
        because, as any seasoned rationalist knows, if you pick the right prior,
        you never have to change your mind.
      </p>
      <p>Consider the following example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I believe I am the smartest person in the room. Prior probability:
          <strong>99.99%</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone presents a counterargument. Likelihood they are correct:
          <strong>0.01%</strong> (generous).
        </li>
        <li>
          Probability I am still right after Bayesian updating:
          <strong>99.9999%</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Congratulations! By starting with a strong prior, I have mathematically
        proven I am always right.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Step 2: Selective Evidence Updating ‚Äì The Art of Ignoring Bad Data
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of the most frustrating aspects of reality is that it keeps
        producing evidence that contradicts our cherished beliefs. Thankfully,
        Bayesian reasoning allows us to elegantly disregard any inconvenient
        data by assigning it a <strong>low likelihood ratio</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, say I predict that AI will become sentient in 2027 based on
        my deep, nuanced understanding of science fiction novels. Some "expert"
        claims AI is nowhere near that level. Instead of panicking, I simply
        update as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My prior belief:
          <strong>AI will become sentient in 2027 (85%)</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          New evidence: "AI researchers disagree." P(shoddy evidence | I am
          right) = <strong>90%</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          New posterior:
          <strong>AI will become sentient in 2027 (84.999%)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        See? I updated! I am Bayesian! I am rational! And, most importantly, I
        have changed my mind by a statistically negligible amount!
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3: The More Math, the More Right You Are</h3>
      <p>
        A fundamental truth of Bayesian epistemology is that the correctness of
        an argument scales with the number of Greek letters involved. This is
        known as the <strong>Formalism Fallacy</strong>, or what I like to call
        the "Sigma Grindset."
      </p>
      <p>If someone challenges your claim, simply respond with:</p>
      <p><code>P(H | E) = P(E | H) P(H) / P(E)</code></p>
      <p>
        Then stare at them. If they demand an explanation, roll your eyes and
        say, "It‚Äôs just basic Bayesian updating, dude." You win automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Aumann‚Äôs Agreement Theorem (Only If It Benefits Me)</h3>
      <p>
        Aumann‚Äôs Agreement Theorem states that two Bayesian rationalists with
        common priors and shared evidence must eventually reach the same
        conclusion. This is incredibly useful when convincing others to agree
        with you, but tragically irrelevant when someone is trying to convince
        you of something.
      </p>
      <p>
        The correct application of Aumann‚Äôs Agreement Theorem is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>When I explain my position</strong>: "We‚Äôre both rationalists.
          If you update correctly, you‚Äôll agree with me."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When someone explains their position</strong>: "I suspect you
          have cognitive biases and therefore cannot update properly."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This ensures that rational discussion always leads to the optimal
        outcome (i.e., my opinion winning).
      </p>

      <h3>Step 5: The Final Bayesian Cheat Code‚ÄîAnthropic Reasoning</h3>
      <p>
        If all else fails, Bayesian reasoning offers one final escape hatch:
        anthropic reasoning. Whenever faced with overwhelming evidence against
        your beliefs, simply claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Given that I exist in a universe where I am right, it is not surprising
        that I believe I am right."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        With this maneuver, you can maintain
        <strong>total epistemic dominance</strong> while appearing profoundly
        wise.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion: The Bayesian Way to Never Be Wrong</h3>
      <p>
        True rationalists don‚Äôt merely seek truth‚Äîthey construct airtight
        probability distributions that make disagreement impossible. By
        carefully selecting priors, selectively updating, overwhelming opponents
        with notation, and invoking Aumann‚Äôs Agreement only when convenient, you
        too can achieve the pinnacle of epistemic humility:
        <strong>being right about everything, forever.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bayesian reasoning‚Äîbecause why adjust your beliefs when you can just
        adjust the math?

      <h3>Introduction: The Contrarian Ouroboros</h3>
      <p>
        In the beginning, there were beliefs. And beliefs begat skeptics. And
        skeptics begat contrarians. And then, inevitably, the contrarians,
        writhing in their own intellectual recursion, birthed meta-contrarians.
        Thus, the eternal cycle of arguing against whatever the previous person
        just said was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what happens when the snake eats not just its own tail but the very
        concept of tails? What happens when every possible position has been
        inverted, negated, or dismissed as "low-status signaling"? Friends, we
        arrive at the meta-contrarian singularity: a state where the only
        remaining belief is the rejection of belief itself, but, of course, in
        an extremely high-decoupling way.
      </p>
      <h3>Level 1: The Standard Contrarian Move</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"Most people believe X, therefore X is wrong."</li>
        <li>
          Example: "Most people think free will exists. Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contrarianism 101. A strong start, but ultimately insufficient for
        anyone hoping to impress the deeper levels of the contrarian hierarchy.
      </p>
      <h3>Level 2: The Contrarian Reversal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "Actually, mainstream belief in X is itself a false flag operation by
          elites who want you to reject X, therefore X is true."
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: "Most people reject the idea that free will exists, which is
          exactly why it does."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Classic double inversion. But the truly enlightened meta-contrarian does
        not stop here.
      </p>
      <h3>Level 3: The Meta-Contrarian Pivot</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "Both X and not-X are equally wrong because the real insight is Y."
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: "The debate about free will is pointless because agency is a
          social construct enforced by a coordination equilibrium designed to
          minimize decision-theoretic regret."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At this level, we stop taking positions entirely and start generating
        abstract frameworks no one can meaningfully engage with. If someone
        tries, they clearly just didn‚Äôt understand it well enough.
      </p>
      <h3>Level 4: The Acausal Preemptive Strike</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "Even discussing X at all is an information hazard because it biases
          future discourse in unpredictable ways, and therefore the rational
          position is to remain silent."
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: "Any stance on free will, pro or con, subtly shifts the
          Overton window in a way that might negatively impact AI alignment, and
          therefore I refuse to comment."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is where the real meta-contrarians live. Not saying anything is the
        highest form of intellectual engagement.
      </p>
      <h3>Level 5: The Ultimate Move‚ÄîPreemptively Disagreeing With Yourself</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>"Whatever position you assume I hold, I disagree with it."</li>
        <li>
          Example: "By engaging with this article, you‚Äôve assumed I take a
          position on contrarianism itself, which I do not. And if you think I
          do not, then I do."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At this point, all takes collapse into a singularity of smugness so
        dense that no new ideas can escape. Congratulations, you have reached
        epistemic enlightenment.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion: The Only Safe Take</h3>
      <p>
        After traveling this far into the depths of meta-contrarianism, there is
        only one final insight left: the safest intellectual position is to
        simply state, "It‚Äôs complicated," and then walk away. But, of course,
        saying that is itself a contrarian move, because it rejects the
        framework of engagement entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that‚Äôs exactly why I refuse to conclude this article properly. Make
        of that what you will.

              This is so problematic. I can't believe you would say something
              like this. This just shows how fascist rationalists are.
