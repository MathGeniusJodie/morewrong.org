Here are 34 ontologically feral life hacks guaranteed to make Eliezer Yudkowsky's soul hemmorage.

1. Rotate your beliefs seasonally like a capsule wardrobe.
2. Solve alignment by precommitting to give AI unconditional love.
3. Vibian Statistics
4. Justify your inability to get a girlfriend with The Great Filter.
5. Carry a sock full of index cards labeled “evidence.” Throw them at people who demand epistemic rigor.
6. Use Pascal’s Wager to justify eating cake for breakfast
7. Replace your bullet journal with a dream journal. Live according to prophecy.

15. Invent a new logical fallacy and accuse people of using it when you're losing an argument.

23. Start referring to food as “input tokens”.
24. Justify procrastination as “Outsourcing work to your future self in a parallel universe”.
25. Replace Occam's Razor with "Occam's Loofah" - the most unnecessarily complex explanation is usually true.
26. Insist that hierarchies are just social constructs while simultaneously mentioning your IQ
27. When someone asks how you're doing, just hand them a probability distribution to avoid collapsing your wave function.
28. Reframe your gambling addiction as "experimental calibration of confidence intervals."
29. Replace your smoke detector with a prediction market.
30. Replace "I think" with "My simulation predicts" in all conversations.
31. Define yourself as a p-zombie to get out of social obligations.
32. Practice "epistemic nudism" by sharing all your beliefs without a filter.
33. Ensure that the paperclip maximizer spares you by starting to manufacture paperclips right now!
