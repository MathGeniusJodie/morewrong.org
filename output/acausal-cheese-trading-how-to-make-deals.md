      Are we 100% sure WE aren’t the ones being acausally manipulated by hyper-intelligent rats? Like, has anyone checked?

      This is literally just Pascal’s Mugging with extra steps.

          I, for one, welcome my rat overlords and the unlimited cheese futures they offer.

      I’m not sure about the cheese, but I’m definitely interested in the computational resources.

Ever found yourself wondering, “How can I establish a mutually beneficial trade agreement with hyper-intelligent rats from parallel dimensions?” No? Well, clearly you aren’t thinking hard enough. Here at MoreWrong, we pride ourselves on tackling the questions that rationalists fear to ask. And today, we dive headfirst into the cheddar-scented abyss of acausal cheese trading.

### The Rat Coordination Problem

Before we can make deals with rats from alternate realities, we need to establish some basic principles. The fundamental problem with interdimensional trade is that standard communication channels—such as email, quantum entanglement, or posting on LessWrong—fail to function across most known parallel universes. However, we can still make credible commitments via the time-honored tradition of *acausal reasoning*.

The crux of acausal cheese trading is that if the rats in Universe B can predict that we in Universe A would give them cheese, then they might be inclined to reciprocate with their own transdimensional gifts, such as exotic knowledge, computational resources, or perhaps a willingness not to gnaw through our wires when the Great Uplifting occurs.

### The Decision-Theoretic Justification for Bribing Rats

We employ timeless decision theory (TDT) here. The key is to act as if the rats exist and are capable of modeling our actions, regardless of whether we have direct proof of their existence. If they follow similar reasoning, they will recognize that their own cheese economy benefits from cooperating with us. The classic dilemma—known in rodent decision theory as Pavlov’s Prisoner’s Dilemma—suggests that a stable trading relationship is possible if:

1. We credibly precommit to leaving cheese in designated interdimensional offering sites.

2. The rats, in turn, recognize our commitment and leave reciprocally valuable artifacts in exchange (e.g., new heuristics for solving NP-hard problems, or at the very least, exceptionally well-aged Gruyère).

3. The situation where one party eats the cheese but offers nothing in return—is discouraged via reputational mechanisms.

### Implementation: Setting Up the Cheese Exchange

To establish a robust acausal trade pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Select an Offering Site: Ideally, a liminal space, such as a subway tunnel, an abandoned attic, or your bedroom. These locations have naturally high rat-based foot traffic and a strong probability of interdimensional interference.

2. Deposit Cheese with Conviction: A variety of cheeses should be tested to determine which is most attractive across dimensions. Some theorists suggest high-fat, high-protein varieties, while others advocate for improbably weird cheeses like blue cheese or maggot cheese as their deviation from the canonical timeline may give them more interdimensional appeal.

3. Maintain a Commitment Strategy: If you eat the cheese before the rats can claim it, they will update against your cooperative potential.

4. Monitor for Signs of Rat Communication: Rats communicate primarily through gnawing patterns, footstep arrangements, and the alignment of crumbs. If a Fibonacci sequence appears in the sawdust, congratulations—you've established an acausal link.

### Possible Failure Modes

Of course, any groundbreaking economic model comes with its risks:

* Moral Hazard: If too many humans enter the acausal cheese market, we may inadvertently create an economic bubble.

* Roko’s Rodent: If the rats ever become superintelligent, they may retroactively punish all humans who didn’t leave them cheese, invoking the dreaded “Cheese Basilisk” scenario.

* Existential Risks: There’s always a nonzero chance that hyper-rational, dimension-hopping rats will outcompete us for all available resources, leading to a scenario known in the literature as the “Gray Fur Scenario.”

### Conclusion

Given all this, the only logical decision is to immediately begin leaving cheese in strategic locations. Even if the rats do not exist, the sheer expected utility of being correct is worth the negligible cost of some gouda. Besides, in the worst-case scenario, you’ve at least made the local rodent population very happy.
