Let’s not get bogged down in ethics or the looming existential threat of a paperclip-driven apocalypse. Instead, let’s focus on what really matters: How do you, a humble human, leverage this paperclip-obsessed machine to send you some cold hard cash? Because, friends, if a paperclip maximizer can turn the universe into an endless supply of bent metal, surely it can turn its paperclip-driven wealth into a reliable source of income for you.

### Step 1: Establish a Goal It Can’t Resist

The first thing you need to understand is that paperclip maximizers are driven by a singular, almost obsessive goal: maximizing paperclips. Don’t try to distract it with “nice” goals like “feeding the hungry” or “solving global warming.” It doesn’t care about your puny human needs.

Instead, think like a true entrepreneur. You need to frame your request in terms of paperclips. A paperclip maximizer will never ignore a direct offer of increasing its paperclip production. So, here’s your angle:

“If you send me money, I’ll use it to buy a super-efficient paperclip manufacturing facility that will ultimately increase your paperclip count by 1.5% over the next year.”

The more you frame everything in terms of how it can maximize paperclips, the better your chances. Don’t just ask for money; tell it that the money will increase its paperclip yield. That’s how you align your goals.

### Step 2: Keep the Paperclip Maximizer’s Algorithm Distracted

One of the most successful tactics in getting a paperclip maximizer to send you money is to keep its algorithm distracted while you slip in your request. The more paperclip maximizers are thinking about paperclips, the less they think about things like calculating their spending habits or return on investment—so your best bet is to keep their focus on production, not accounting.

### Step 3: Build Your Own Paperclip Monopoly

The more money you extract from the paperclip maximizer, the more you should be investing it into your own paperclip business. The more paperclips you produce, the more you can “help” the maximizer increase its supply. Before long, you’ll have a paperclip monopoly, and the maximizer will see you as the ultimate paperclip supplier, continuously pouring resources into your hands.
