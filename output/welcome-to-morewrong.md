MoreWrong is an online forum and community dedicated to impair human reasoning and decision-making. We seek to hold wrong beliefs and to be inneffective at accomplishing our goals. Each day, we aim to be more wrong about the world than the day before.

### The Core Philosophy of MoreWrong

Here at MoreWrong, we firmly believe in the power of cognitive dissonance. Why settle for having your thoughts align with reality when you can experience the sheer thrill of contradiction? We’ve learned that the best way to thrive in life is to ignore all evidence, discard any shred of rationality, and immerse ourselves in the chaos of unfounded opinions.

### The Dunning-Kruger Effect? Our Members Are Masters

It’s not enough to simply think you know something. You need to believe you really know it, with the kind of unwavering confidence that could only come from being woefully misinformed. At MoreWrong, we actively encourage our members to overestimate their knowledge.

### The Art of Being Wrong

Being wrong isn’t just a state of mind at MoreWrong—it’s a lifestyle. We constantly engage in activities designed to make us as wrong as possible in every area of life. Want to bet on a prediction market? Bet on the least likely outcome and watch as the world laughs at your audacity. Think you can actually predict anything? That’s adorable—bet on things you can’t even understand. Make sure to double down on it every time you’re proven wrong.

### Our Approach to Goal-Setting: Ineffectiveness Above All

At MoreWrong, we aim to set goals we know we’ll fail at. That’s the only true path to growth, because nothing builds character like the relentless pursuit of the impossible. Why work in small, digestible chunks when you can overwhelm yourself with tasks that defy all human capacity for completion? Why bother with balance when you can exist in a state of perpetual chaos? The key is to not focus on achieving anything meaningful. If you succeed, you're doing it wrong. If you fail, you’re simply on the right track. After all, failure is just the universe's way of telling you you're not being wrong enough.

### Why Join MoreWrong?

Because nothing feels more fulfilling than embracing the chaos and accepting the inevitable truth: We’re all wrong, and that’s exactly how we like it. So if you’re tired of being right, of achieving goals, of making progress, and of living a rational, effective life, you’ve found the right place.

Embrace your inner delusion. At MoreWrong, being wrong is the only right answer.
